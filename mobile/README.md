# WYN Remnants Mobile App

This folder will contain the React Native (Expo) mobile source code.

Planned structure:

- `App.js` – root component with drawer navigation and Google sign-in logic.
- `navigation/` – React Navigation configuration.
- `screens/` – individual UI screens.
- `assets/` – images, icons, etc.
- `android/` & `ios/` – generated after `npx expo prebuild` (eject).
